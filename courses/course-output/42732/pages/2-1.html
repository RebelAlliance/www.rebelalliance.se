      <h1>Continuous Improvement</h1>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <a href="../img/2-1-1.JPG"><img  class="col-sm-3" src="../img/2-1-1.JPG" alt="" style="float:right; max-width: 100%;" /></a>
                <p>Continuous improvement is at the heart of all things Lean and Agile, it is the most core concept and the one that is most important to get working well, because if you can continuously improve everything else is possible to fix. Different names are given to this concept depending on context and method, but all Agile and Lean implementations have it in some form or another.</p>
                <p>Toyota considered this concept so important that “Kaizen Culture” is one of the two pillars of their entire company philosophy. The most important thing to grasp about continuous improvement is that it needs to be done by the people actually doing the work, it is vital that Agile and Lean teams be able to self organise around this concept.</p>
                <p>Another important concept to understand with continuous improvement, is because we are doing these changes at regular intervals instead of only after the failure of a project, we do not need to conceive of the perfect solution all the time. We simply need to devise a small experiment and reflect later if that experiment has been successful or not, if it has we will keep the change, if not we can simply devise a new experiment.</p>
                <p>One of the most common failure points in an Agile implementation is a team's lack of knowledge on how to improve systematically. Agility works to enhance transparency at all levels, but a corollary to this is that issues will start to become more visible, without methods for addressing these issues, friction will ensue. Some of the most common patterns for for conceptualising and implementing continuous improvement are detailed in the following section.</p>

        <h2>Coffee Room Whining Pattern:</h2>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>This pattern was created and iterated by the authors of this material Ola Berg and Jeff Campbell. Taking this unique viewpoint of Retrospective has helped them both to make their Retrospectives more productive and engaging.</p>
                <p>It is entirely possible to have Retrospectives that are not only ineffective, but often times counter effective as they follow a pattern which we are all too familiar with in our organisations. Called “Coffee Room Whining”. First let's examine the pattern of “Coffee Room Whining” to understand what is meant by this, which has three primary symptoms.</p>
                  <h3>Talk About Everything:</h3>
                    <p>We sit down, and are able to see ALL the problems that exist in our organisation, no matter how big it is.</p>
                  <h3>Someone Else’s Fault:</h3>
                    <p>Once we have identified everything that is wrong, we inevitably find out that it is someone else's fault and responsibility to fix. The someone else in this case always seems to be a manager of some kind.</p>
                  <h3>Nothing Changes:</h3>
                    <p>As a result, we get up from the table, go back to our desks, and absolutely nothing changes as a result of the discussion we just had. Actually, to say nothing changes is inaccurate, we actually end up every so slightly bitter from the experience than we were before.</p>
                  <h3>Seeing It In Yourself:</h3>
                    <p>It is simple to identify this pattern in our Retrospectives and follow this pattern will inevitably end up in us seeing no point in doing our Retrospectives anymore.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>We create a list of 15-20 things that we were unhappy about during the previous Sprint <strong>(Talk About Everything)</strong>.</li>
                        <li>We determine there is absolutely nothing we can do about it and hand the list to our Scrum Master to sort out with the people who are really to blame <strong>(Someone Else’s Fault)</strong>.</li>
                        <li>We come back at the end of our next Sprint and have the exact same discussion all over again and the cycle repeats <strong>(Nothing Changes)</strong>.</li>
                      </ul>
                  <p>The “Coffee Room Whining” pattern advocates seeing a Retrospective as the exact position of “Coffee Room Whining”.</p>
                  <h3>Focus On One Thing:</h3>
                    <p>Talking about every issue we have is exhausting, and ineffective. Having an impact on all of our issues at once is completely impossible. It’s also wasteful, because our issues in an organisation tend to be linked to one another, if we affect one we may reduce the impact of the others, we will have spent time discussing issues that may no longer be important. Instead, try to focus on one thing, find whatever the largest bottleneck or issue you have at the moment is, and devote your energy to that.</p>
                  <h3>Focus on what WE can do about it:</h3>
                    <p>No matter what issue we identify, there is always one of three actions we can take to attempt to affect the issue.</p>
                      <h4>Fix it:</h4>
                        <p>Occasionally, we are able to do a root cause analysis and find we are capable of fixing the issue. This does not happen nearly as often as we might like.</p>
                      <h4>Minimise:</h4>
                        <p>Much more frequently we are able to find ways to minimise the issue. We are able to systems or measures in place that reduce the impact of this particular issue to a manageable level.</p>
                      <h4>Inform:</h4>
                        <p>No matter what the issue is, we are always able to inform people that it exist. We make the assumption in “Coffee Room Whining” that people are actually aware an issue exists, this is very often not the case. Understand that sending an email and hoping the issue goes away is not informing about the issue, we need to support those we inform in finding a solution that is acceptable to all those affected by the issue.</p>
                  <h3>Concrete Changes: (Experiments)</h3>
                    <p>As a result of behaving in this manner, we are always able to propose concrete experiments to attempt to impact the issue we are discussing. These changes should always be actionable, and if possible incorporated as PBI’s or tasks in our next Sprint.</p>
