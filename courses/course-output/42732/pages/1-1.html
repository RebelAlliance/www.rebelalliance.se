      <h1>Intro to Agile Principles</h1>

        <h2>What Is Agility?</h2>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <img  class="col-sm-3" src="../img/1-1-1.JPG" alt="" style="float:right; max-width: 100%;" />
                <p>Agility is the ability to change direction fast, at a low cost. It is not the attribute of some method, it is instead the attribute of an organisation, a project, a team, or some other collaboration.</p>
                <p>Agility is a crucial attribute to have if you want to survive and thrive in changing environments. To an organisation, there are lot of environmental factors that call for the ability to change: there are new technologies you could exploit, new market opportunities are popping up, changes in customer demand call for reprioritization etc.</p>
                <p>For a software development organisation there is another factor that makes agility very important even if both the market and the technology were not to change. Software is codified knowledge about a certain solution. In order to be codified, the knowledge needs to be refined. In order to be refined, there is a need for constant learning, exploration, problem solving etc taking place. Small changes in the requirements can potentially cause large deviations from earlier expectations. This makes software development notoriously hard to plan. The ability to change within reasonable cost frames becomes therefore more important than the ability to stick to a plan that will erode anyway.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h2>A Brief History Of Agile Methods</h2>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>In the old days when you bought a computer system, you basically bought a computer. They used simple programs, for instance to update the salary of employee and record on tape memory, or to perform calculations. They weren’t really systems in the modern sense of the word.</p>
                <p>When computers became smaller and grew in numbers during the 80s, things started to change. Suddenly organisations wanted to connect them to each other and have programs running on them modifying data in real time. Complexity grew, and as a consequence also the failures to deliver on time, in budget, and working systems that people can use. It is hard to create computer systems. How do you increase the chances of success?</p>
                <p>One line of thought drew ideas from the concept of “projects”, well known from the field of construction work. The idea is that you actually can establish the wanted piece of software as a goal early in the process, determine the activities that you need to perform in order to achieve that goal, understand what kind of resources and people you need in each step, and just have the organisation follow that plan in a disciplined manner. </p>
                <p>The organisation becomes like a train on a track of plans heading towards the town at the end of the line. </p>
                <p>It is just that the town won’t stand still. The goal will change, as the understanding of the problem and its solutions change. There is no way to fully predict what effects a small change in the requirements will have. There are unknown dependencies hidden in the problem, and when those are uncovered, the plan becomes obsolete.</p>
                <p>This led to the other line of thought based upon the idea to reduce complexity by breaking the problem down into smaller problems and solve them independently. The benefits of using this approach to solve complex technical issues was discovered during the 50s and 60s. A number of failed projects in the US, where they wanted to create complex weapon systems, taught the military that such development was best done in iterations, where you develop part by part and adjust the design and the plan as you learn.</p>
                <p>During the 70s, US Navy and US Army performed numerous gigantic software projects in several one-month iterations. Almost every one of those projects were completed on time and under budget. During the 80s however, the US Department of Defence experienced many huge failures when they standardized around a waterfall-like project approach. They reported failure in up to 75% of their projects.</p>
                <p>In 1987, the Department of Defence allowed for iterative development again, and during the 90s the iterative approach gained popularity.</p>
                <p>In order to break down complex computer problems into smaller components, the object oriented techniques had been invented. And it was among people interested in object oriented modelling techniques that the agile methods were born during the 90s wave of iterative approaches. In these communities they experimented with the techniques that are familiar components of almost every agile framework and method today: self-organized teams, close collaboration with customers or their representatives, frequent replans, small iterations etc. </p>
                <p>Those techniques were collected into what is now known as agile methods.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h2>How Do The Agile Methods Work?</h2>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>Let us return to the analogy of the project plan as a railroad track. When trying to reach a moving target, it is impractical to ride on a train. The critical success factor when trying to get to a station on the line - stay on track - becomes a guarantee for failure when the target moves. It is better to behave as a homing missile instead.</p>
                <p>Homing missiles operate by asking two questions: “Where am I, and where is my target?” and then adjusting its course accordingly. By doing this frequently, the missile eventually hits the target, even though the target constantly tries to escape.</p>
                <p>In agile circles, we call this the principle of inspect and adapt. Look at the current situation compared to where you want to be, and adapt your course accordingly. The agile methods work by increasing the ability for groups to be better at this. They create many parallel feedback loops within an organisation. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <img src="../img/1-1-2.JPG" class="img-responsive">
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Inspection Demands Transparency</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>In order to adapt, you need the power to do so. It is of no use if you see that you should change course, but you lack the power to control the vehicle. </p>
                <p>Power is a combination of mandate and ability. Mandate is what most often comes to mind when you talk about power: the right to try to change things by some means. But the ability to change the right thing in the right way is just as important for having the power to actually steer.</p>
                <p>There is a problem if those who have the ability to control something in the process lack the mandate to do so. It is also a problem if those who have the mandate lack sufficient ability to control the situation. Agile methods shift mandate so that those with the ability to steer something also get the right to do it. Agile methods also brings more capabilities to those who already have a mandate, increasing their ability. </p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Adaption Demands Power</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>In order to be able to inspect the current situation, we need transparency. The problem in many organisations of today is that important facts about the current situation are hidden. There is no way of finding out where we are or where our target is. </p>
                <p>Agile methods employ techniques for increasing transparency: a visible backlog with things to do, a board where the progress can be traced, meaningful and truthful conversations within and between teams.</p>
                <p>Transparency must constantly be instituted. There is a natural tendency for information to be hidden in chaotic daily work. There is also a possibility that the increased transparency due to agile methods can hurt people’s feelings so that they block the increased agility. This must be fought against, since without transparency all methods become meaningless.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Agility May Hurt</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>A dancer has an agile body. That agility wasn’t achieved without some pain. Just as the dancer needs to exercise and stretch in order to become agile, you need to use the techniques in a way that actually changes things if you want the organisation to become agile. And just as the exercises and stretching hurts a bit, so will the techniques that drive agility.</p>

                <p>One aspect of the hurt is of course the shift in mandates. You may lose a mandate you previously had. Another source of pain has to do with the feedback loops being fast. But the most pain from the agile methods stems from the fact that the methods makes the current situation visible. If you are at fault for parts of the situation today, that will show, regardless of your position in the organisation. This will cause some pain, and it is very important that everyone is aware of this potential side-effect, because there is really no alternative to transparency. You cannot drive blindfolded, even if you otherwise would have perfect ability.</p>

                <p>So one can say that the agile methods aren’t agile. They might even feel a bit rigid. But they have the potential to make us agile, should we use them as intended.</p>
              </div>

        <h2>The Agile Manifesto</h2>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>In 2001 a man called “Uncle” Bob Martin, organised an event where the pioneers in the movement wanted to explore the factors that united their approaches to software development. They came up with a “manifesto” that stated what they had in common. This is what they said about it:</p>
                <div class="col-sm-2 text-center"></div>
                <div class="col-sm-8 text-center">                
                <p><i><small>In February of 2001, seventeen practitioners of several programming methodologies came together at a summit in Utah to discuss the problems of existing heavyweight methodologies, the ways to overcome those, and the values to support lightweight software development. The result was the Agile Manifesto:</small></i></p>
                <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
                <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
                  <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
                  </ul>
                <p><strong>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-2 text-center"></div>
                </div>
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p><p>Let us go through these, starting with the second point and then point number one, three, and four.</p></p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Working Software</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>For agile, just as for any effort in the “lean” family of collaboration methods, the purpose is to create value. Value is something that a person appreciates and finds beneficial to use. For a software developing organisation the measure of value making is of course its ability to create software that works, that are useful to a user.</p>

                <p>Documentation is important. You might need to spread knowledge how to use the software, help maintaining it, knowing how to find your way in the source code, or something similar. But the primary value is when you are able to create software that works and helps. Without working software, the documentation is useless.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Individuals And Interactions</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Software is codified knowledge about a problem domain and solution domain. In order to be able to create software you have to understand a situation, come up with an idea on how to solve the problems that the users may find in that situation, be able to spread that knowledge among a group of people.</p>

                <p>Knowledge is born in people and lives within people. People is the most important asset in knowledge work. The problem with knowledge is that it isn’t easily spread. Knowledge is transferred through meaningful interactions, and those can be hard to facilitate. But for those organisations that can create lots of meaningful conversations, there is more potential in a great interacting team than in any single individual. That is why agile methods focus on people and their interactions.</p>

                <p>Processes and tools are very important. But the tools and processes are only useful if they support good interactions. Tools can hinder and processes can hinder. If the tools and processes aren’t supporting meaningful interaction between people, they are not only useless. They are dangerous.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Customer Collaboration</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Tight collaboration with the customer or a customer's representative is key. When Standish Group measured success factors for system development projects, involvement of the customer or end user was a more important factor than what method they used. </p>

                <p>This is just a special case of the first point that states that individuals and interactions are more important than processes and tools. Individuals and interactions including customer collaborations are more important than processes and tools, including the tool of contract negotiations.</p>

                <p>Contracts are useful when things go wrong. Collaboration ensures it doesn't.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Responding To Change</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Plans should change as knowledge evolves. That is what makes us agile. Since the requirements are so volatile and ought to be changed as soon as new information emerges, the ability to replan quick and without much cost is more important that our ability to stick to a plan. </p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h2>Conclusion and Summary:</h2>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Agile methods are many and varied, but the core principles remain the same throughout.</p>
                  <h3>Agile:</h3>
                  <p>Is a property of an organisation, project or team not a specific method.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Ability to change direction fast.</li>
                    <li>Ability to change direction at low cost.</li>
                    <li>Specifically suited to software development.</li>
                    <li>Has it’s roots in Lean.</li>
                    <li>Has been practiced long before it was named Agile.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Agile methods:</h3>
                    <p>Agile methods while having different implementations all share a number of common characteristics.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Create transparency.</li>
                    <li>Creates mandate throughout the organisation.</li>
                    <li>Increases ability throughout the organisation.</li>
                    <li>Cause pain in the beginning.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Agile Manifesto:</h3>
                    <p>Outlines the principles that guide all Agile methods.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
                    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
