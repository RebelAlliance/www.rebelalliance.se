      <h1>Scrum</h1>
        <h2>What is Scrum Anyway?</h2>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <a href="../img/1-2-1.JPG"><img  class="col-sm-8" src="../img/1-2-1.JPG" alt="" style="float:right; max-width: 100%;" /></a>
                <p>Scrum is a framework used primarily for software development, which focuses on providing incremental and iterative deliveries of small piece of a product or project. It is meant to provide higher degrees of flexibility, and focuses on a more holistic view of the product being built than traditional project models.</p>
                <p>Scrum has a heavy emphasis on transparency and communication with the goal of higher flexibility, providing solutions that are more likely to satisfy our customers needs, and mitigating the inherent risks that come with large projects.</p>
                <h3>Incremental and Iterative:</h3>          
                <p>As opposed to a traditional “waterfall” project, where we attempt to specify the entire project before hand, and then plan the entire implementation phase before work begins of actually creating the solution, Scrum advocates performing smaller increments of each stage over and over again. This has numerous advantages over a traditional approach that will be detailed throughout this section.</p>
              </div>
          </div>



        <h3>Flexibility:</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>In a traditional project model, the scope of a project is fixed over long periods of time, which makes changing expensive and undesirable. In Scrum, scope is fixed for a maximum of one month at a time, which makes change not only possible but desirable, as we can incorporate new information that is gained throughout the project. </p>
                <p>Because of each iterations of the product being basically a new project being started anything not currently being worked on can be changed or re-prioritised without having an effect on the work that has already taken place. This allows us harness this flexibility to the advantage of those who purchase our products and services. </p>
                <p>For example, in a Scrum project, we are able to decide to release at the end of any interaction, allowing us to release a product with a smaller feature set, and possibly start earning money immediately. As opposed to a traditional approach, where we have no choice but to wait until the end of the project.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Holistic View:</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>One of the fundamental principles of Scrum is that the activity of software development is too complex for each stage of the process to exist in a vacuum. Scrum advocates that interaction and collaboration between all people involved in a project is required in order to deliver “the right thing”. For instance, an expert tester might have information about a user's behaviour that a designer or architect does not, and only through those roles collaborating can we truly discover what the best solution to a customer's problem is.</p>
                <p>This concept states that fundamental learning can take place at any point during a project, and that it is not possible to understand everything that needs to be understood up front, making traditional planning approaches fundamentally flawed in the context of developing software. For example, a customer may not realise exactly what they need until they have tried another solution first, in a traditional project this learning would only take place at the end of the project.</p>
                <p>One of the core principles of Scrum is to constantly “Inspect and Adapt”, to look at our current situation and adjust our plans and actions according to the new information that has become available to us.</p>
                <p>This is a large departure from traditional project models, which are focused on specifying everything up front, and then breaking that specification into a large number of predictable steps to be executed.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>A framework:</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Scrum describes itself as a framework, rather than a methodology or process. This is an important distinction to understand, because Scrum in and of itself is not a complete solution. Scrum is meant to provide a set of tools that allow you to get up and running quickly with a move towards agility, but, there are many problems that Scrum does not directly address. For example, Scrum says nothing in particular about the technical aspects of building a product which are extremely important with a move to agility.</p>
                <p>Scrum is simply one tool to help you on the road to agility, it is meant to provide you a safe framework in which to experiment with what works well in your specific context. Scrum can be an excellent starting point on your journey, but it is not the final destination. And most importantly, it is not a “silver bullet” that will solve all of your problems simply by following the rules.</p>
                <p>As anyone who has ever worked in a Scrum team can tell you, simply putting some post it notes up on the way does not an agile team make.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h2>How Does Scrum Work?</h2>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>       
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Scrum as a whole is nothing more complex than a collection of three roles, five events, and three artifacts. But don’t let Scrums simplicity fool you, while you can learn all the basic rules in a day or so, becoming an expert requires a lot of dedication and work, just like most other types of work. Think of Scrum as being very similar to Chess, you can learn the rules very quickly, but to become a grandmaster take a lot of time, energy, effort, and dedication.</p>
                <p>The basics of the Scrum framework are laid out in the following section. For the purposes of better understanding, they are not laid out with all the events at once, then all the roles and so on. Also, some concepts will be simplified in the beginning and elaborated throughout the material. However there is a summary at the end of this section which can provide you an overview of each once you are done. </p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Throughout this section Scrum Master tips are given, it is best to review these after having an overview of Scrum (i.e. the end of the material), rather than where they fall in the document.</p>
                <p>Also, it is important to note that Scrum is constantly being refined so, this material will eventually go out of date if not maintained.</p>
                <p>For the official (always up to date) document which describes Scrum and all it entails please visit <a href="http://www.scrum.org">www.scrum.org</a></p>
                <p>Small parts of this material are taken directly from the Scrum Guide.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>The Development Team: (Role)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>The heart and soul of any project is the team, without the people who do the work, nothing else is possible. Scrum requires the formation of a team which is both Cross Functional, Self Organising, and with no roles.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h4>Cross Functional Teams:</h4>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Cross functionality very simply put, a cross functional team is a team that consists of all the skills sets required to bring a product from inception to completion, or as it is often stated “from concept to cash”. For this reason the development teams consists of more than just people who write code. Development teams of consist of specialists like designers, programmers, testers, architects, business requirements specialists, documentation specialists, and a variety of other roles.</p>
                <p>Exactly who is in your team will vary greatly depending on your specific context, but if you keep this simple rule in mind you should always continue in the right direction. Does your team have all the competences required to take things from and idea, do existing in production? If the answer is yes, you have a cross functional team. If the answer is no it is perhaps time to Inspect what competence you need, and consider Adapting your team constellation.</p>
                <p>For purposes of fostering ideal communication your development team should be no more than nine people, excluding the Scrum Master and Product Owner. Teams of more than nine people tend to create too much complexity in the communication and collaboration for an empirical process model to work well.</p>
                <p>In order to ensure that there are no knowledge gaps in a team and a sufficient amount of work can be accomplished, the development team should not be less that three people. Also, since teams of two or less generally have good communication and collaboration, Scrum often adds excessive overhead for what is required in such a small team.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h4>Self Organising Teams:</h4>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Scrum can only be successful if all the team members involved are empowered to do what is needed to get the work done. In this spirit we must trust that the people in our team are responsible and  mature enough to do what is required to deliver the required functionality. It is for these reasons that no one in the Scrum framework has the authority to tell the development team how to bring the requests through to completion. The development team are masters of their craft, and they are the experts on how to complete the objectives that are laid out for them.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>The Development Team: (Role) cont…</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>When these factors combine together, what we arrive at from the rest of the organisation's perspective is one incredibly competent person (as pictured above). This person has all the skills we need to accomplish our goals, we can simply provide them with the vision of what we are trying to accomplish, and they are able to make it into a reality.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Stakeholders:</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Our organisations consist of a multitude of people who require their ideas to become reality, these people are the project's stakeholders. They represent many different facets, viewpoints, and needs. These are the people who help us to ensure we creating the right things, and that these things are solving the problems they were intended to solve. They all have valuable input to the product we are trying to build.</p>
                <p>Just like the development team, who these people are varies greatly depending on your organisation and who your customers are. Some common examples of stakeholders to a team are managers, other departments, other companies, other teams, and the most frequently forgotten of these the development team itself who also has a very important stake in the product we are building.</p>
                <p>The issue that most often arises, since all of these stakeholders have different priorities, is that they work to get what they consider the highest priority done at all costs. The issue with this is, that they often ask people directly in the teams do these things for them. The resulting effect of this, is that the teams end up consisting of members who all have a different set of priorities. Teams are more effective when they work together as a team, which is not possible when all teams members are serving different masters.</p>
                <p>It becomes impossible for the team to Self Organise. Which results in all stakeholders getting less of what they need.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>The Product Backlog: (Artifact)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>In order to deal with conflicting priorities in Scrum, we have a very simple artifact that provides transparency to all in the organisation what the current priorities are, The Product Backlog. The Product Backlog simply put is nothing more complex than an ordered list of the work to be done on the product. This makes it clear to all in the organisation what the current organisational priorities are, it is the single source for work to be done. The backlog contains all types of work to be done, new features, bugs, maintenance and so forth.</p>
                <p>The product backlog is a living artifact, at any given time it merely represents our priorities as we know them today, whenever new information or insights become available it is update to reflect the current situation.</p>
                <p>It is important to remember, having the documentation in the backlog is only one piece of the requirements puzzle, in order to fully understand what we will be building, we need to see “Product Backlog Items” (PBI’s) as placeholders for the real requirement gathering, conversations.</p>
                <p>In order to be sure we are investing the right amount of effort at the right times, the backlog often contains various amounts of detail depending on how high priority the various PBI’s are. After all, we don’t want to invest large amounts of time in detailing items that are so low down, that they might never get done. More of maintaining a quality backlog will be detailed later in this material.</p>
                <p>The most important question of The Product Backlog is, how do we make sure we have the best ordering possible?</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>The Product Owner: (Role)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>If we were to simply allow all the stakeholders to edit the backlog however they like, this system would not work very well. Basically, the priority order would be set by whoever the last person to adjust our backlog was before the team looked at it. For this reason, we have the role of The Product Owner (P.O).</p>
                <p>The backlog is the sole property of the P.O, they are responsible for it and everything it contains. The P.O’s main responsibility is to maximise the value that we get from the product backlog, this means making sure we are always focusing on the highest value items, at all times.</p>
                <p>Another way to view the P.O is as the representative of all the stakeholders, they are responsible for listening to all the people who have a stake in the product, and then balancing those needs and wants in order to produce the most valuable results. This is not a role the P.O can accomplish entirely on their own, they would be required to know everything about a product and the people involved in it to accomplish this, which is obviously impossible. In order to be effective in their work, the P.O requires support from the entire organisation, and even more frequently from the team.</p>
                <p>It is vital that all work is prioritised by the P.O, if stakeholders start going around the P.O and backlog to get their items done faster, the system will break down very quickly and we will be back to having conflicting priorities in the team. This means the entire organisation will get less of what they need.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Product Backlog Refinement:</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>How your backlog is managed will vary depending on your context, but the act of maintain the backlog is known as Refinement, and needs to be done in some form or another by every organisation.</p>
                <p>Simply put, refinement is the act of adding more detail to the PBI’s that are approaching the top of the backlog. More detail includes things like user requirements, estimations, questions that need to be answered,  basically anything that we need to know before we can start working on an item. Many teams choose to create what is called a “Definition of Ready” (pictured above), this is basically creating some criteria that PBI’s need to meet before they can actually be worked on. What ready means varies from one organisation to another, it can be as simple as “everyone in the team agrees this can be worked on at any time”, to more complex ones including use cases, business approval, or statistical data.</p>
                <p>Not conducting backlog refinement is one of the most common failure points for early Scrum teams. Backlog refinement is an ongoing process that must happen continually, and while Scrum does not advocate a specific method for doing this, a very simply starting point is to book a small timebox every week to refine the backlog. As a general rule, refinement should not occupy more than 10% of a sprint.</p>
                <p>If you find your team is having very long sprint planning meetings, and the quality of what is coming out of them is questionable, then booking some time to focus on refinement is a simple first step in addressing the issue.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>The Sprint: (Event)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>The Sprint is the most basic event in Scrum, it is the event during which all other events take place, as soon as one Sprint ends, another begins. Sprints are the heartbeat of the Scrum framework, they provide us with a regular rhythm in which to work and ensure we are executing all the other events with an acceptable frequency.</p>
                <p>Simply put, a Sprint is a set piece of time (Timebox), in which everything take place. The timebox for a Sprint is 1-4 weeks. You can determine the length of your Sprint based on the amount of risk your organisation is able to take, but there should always be a preference to shorter time scales, as this reduces the risk of going down the wrong path.</p>
                <p>The goal of a Sprint is always to deliver a Potentially Shippable Increment (PSI) of the product, a small subset of the backlog that can be delivered to the customer, although we may choose not to deliver at that moment, we need to have the option. Without this, Scrum breaks down, as we are no longer able to adapt priorities like from one Sprint to another, as we are starting to create dependencies between them. (More on the PSI later in this material)</p>
                <p>Now that we have a group of people who need work done, a group of people capable of doing the work, a list of each piece of works priority, someone in charge of making sure we are always focusing on the most valuable things, and an amount of time in which to accomplish a small set of goals, where do we go next?</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Sprint Planning: (Event)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Every sprint begins with Sprint Planning, the event where we determine what we will deliver during the coming Sprint, and how we will attempt to deliver it. This is where we pull items from the top of the backlog in the order provided, and determine how many of them we can deliver in our Sprint. Items pulled from the backlog must always be pulled in the order provided by the P.O.</p>
                <p>The timebox for a Sprint Planning is 8 hours for a 1 month Sprint, and appropriately shorter for shorter Sprints. </p>
                <p>Sprint Planning answers the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>What is our goal for this Sprint?</li>
                    <li>What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?</li>
                    <li>How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs.</p>
                <p>If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite other people to attend in order to provide technical or domain advice.</p>
                <p>By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment. </p>
                <p>Then, building the product can begin.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Sprint Backlog: (Artifact)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>The output of the Sprint Planning meeting is the artifact known as the Sprint Backlog. The Sprint Backlog is a collection of all the PBI’s and the specific tasks required to meet the Sprint goals that have been laid out.</p>
                <p>The the main point of the Sprint Backlog makes visible all work The Development team identifies as  required during the coming Sprint, as well as to provide visibility to any emergence that it discovered during the Sprint.</p>
                <p>As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog belongs solely to the Development Team.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Daily Scrum: (Event)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>As we all know, things do not always go perfectly according to plan. Emergent work will be discovered and added to the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint, we will be required to Inspect and Adapt from day to day. The event known as The Daily Scrum is when this is accomplished. It makes sure that new discoveries are communicated to the entire, and that the team has an agreement on how to proceed for the next 24 hours.</p>
                <p>In order to reduce complexity and promote efficiency, The Daily Scrum is timeboxed to 15 minutes a day, and always takes place at the same time and place, of the teams choosing. The Daily Scrum is also the property of The Development Team, it is a meeting to facilitate their self organisation, and should be treated as such. While we invite others to attend the meeting if they wish, we ask them to hold questions and comments until after the meeting, as this can quickly derail the purpose and focus of this event.</p>
                <p>Questions The Development Team seeks to answer:</p>
                    <ul>

        <h3>The Sprint Review: (Event)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>As we reach the end of the Sprint, it is important that we ensure we accomplished the goals we set out to accomplish, and to provide transparency to all those concerned about our success or failure in that respect. The Sprint Review is when we accomplish that. In this event we attempt to elicit feedback from all Stakeholders on the work that has been accomplished, and our coming goals. The Sprint Review is timeboxed to 4 hours for a one month Sprint, and respectively shorter for shorter Sprints.</p>
                <p>The goals of a Sprint review are two fold:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>To inspect the increment delivered during this Sprint.</li>
                    <li>To adapt the Product Backlog to the new learnings we acquired as a result of this Sprint.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>The output of a Sprint Review is always an updated Product Backlog.</p>
                <p>The Sprint Review is one of the most frequently broken meetings during a Scrum implementation. Because early teams often receive criticism from Stakeholders on what they have or have not delivered, the team often wants to stop having the meeting. You absolutely must not stop having this meeting. It is important to understand that if you are receiving criticism in the meeting, that the needs or expectations of your Stakeholders are not being met in someway, that is the issue that needs to be address, and removing the event is not the approach to address it. Remember this simple rule for Sprint Reviews:</p>
                <p class="text-center"><strong><i>“Feedback is never criticism, even if the person giving the feedback doesn’t know that” - Jeff Campbell</i></strong></p>
              </div>
          </div>

        <h3>The Potentially Shippable Increment: (Artifact)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. This is the product and main goal of every Sprint. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,” which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.” It must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it.</p>
                <h4>Definition of Done (DoD):</h4>
                <p>You would be surprised how different people conceive the concept of done. Does done mean that the code is checked in? Does it mean it has been tested? Does it mean the business has approved it? Does it mean it is sitting in production?</p>
                <p>In order to provide transparency of what an increment actually consists of, Scrum teams use what is called a Definition of Done, what is contained in this definition varies from team to team and will need to be designed by you specifically for your context.</p>
                <p>The DoD is not a static thing, it needs to be evolved over time to reflect new learnings that have taken place, so you need to periodically inspect it, and adapt it to your current circumstance. Remember, the DoD is a promise to all involved as to what is meant by done, if the Development Team breaks their DoD and does not make it clear to all involved, then the trust relationship will quickly break down, and collaboration will become impossible.</p>

        <h3>The Sprint Retrospective: (Event)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>To this point, Scrum has focused primarily on what we are building, but, it is equally important to look at how we are building it. Without a continuous improvement of our process, we will never get any better at what we deliver, we may make sure we are delivering the right thing but not that we are delivering in the best way possible. To this end, Scrum has The Sprint Retrospective. The Retrospective is timeboxed to 3 hours for a one month Sprint.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to: </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.</li>
                    <li>Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements. </li>
                    <li>Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work. </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Simply put, the goal of the Retrospective is to make the coming Sprint, better than the last one was. Through this incremental improvement, we seek to constantly improve the lives of all those involved in our product, and ourselves. It is where we inspect and adapt how we work.</p>
                <p>For example, as mentioned before, the DoD needs to periodically be inspected and adapted, the Retrospective is an ideal time in which to do this.</p>
                <p>While the concept of a Retrospective is simple, being successful with them can be quite tricky.. It is worth the effort to focus on improving how this event is conducted, and the output from it is implemented. There are literally hundreds of different methods for running a Retrospective, which can be readily found online. Some of the more common patterns for Retrospectives can be found in the continuous improvement section of this material.</p>

        <h3>The Scrum Master: (Role)</h3>          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Change is hard, people have a habit of wanting to return to their “ordinary” method of doing things, even if they were unhappy with the results of that. To combat this, and accomplish a variety of other purposes, Scrum has The Scrum Master role.</p>
                <p>The Scrum Masters specific duties are many and varied, but they have duties to the entire organisation. The Scrum Master is a servant leader, meaning, they are not in charge of telling people what to do, but responsible for providing help and support where it is required. Thier main duty is to help the organisation learn and grow as an organisation.</p>
                <h4>Duties to Scrum itself:</h4>
                  <p>The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.</p>
                  <p>Simply put, the Scrum Master is in charge of guarding Scrum from being manipulated to a point where it will not function as intended. Referring to an earlier example, early teams often want to remove The Sprint Review, the Scrum Master has a duty to prevent this, as we will be breaking one of Scrums vital feedback loops, and making Scrum dysfunctional in the process.</p>
                <h4>Duties to the Product Owner:</h4>
                  <p>The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in a variety of ways. Some examples include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management.</li>
                    <li>Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items.</li>
                    <li>Understanding product planning in an empirical environment.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value.</li>
                    <li>Understanding and practicing agility.</li>
                    <li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.</li>
                  </ul>
                <h4>Duties to the Development Team:</h4>
                  <p>The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in a variety of ways. Some examples include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality.</li>
                    <li>Helping the Development Team to create high-value products.</li>
                    <li>Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress.</li>
                    <li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.</li>
                    <li>Coaching the Development Team in organisational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.</li>
                  </ul>
                <h4>Duties to the Organisation:</h4>
                  <p>The Scrum Master serves the organization  in a variety of ways. Some examples include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Leading and coaching the organisation in its Scrum adoption.</li>
                    <li>Planning Scrum implementations within the organisation.</li>
                    <li>Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development.</li>
                    <li>Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team.</li>
                    <li>Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organisation.</li>
                  </ul>
