    <h3>About the book:</h3>
    <p>I have been working to help teams and organisations adopt Agile ways of working for close to 10 years now, usually in the role of a Scrum Master or Agile Coach. During this time, I have had the privilege of working with a lot of great teams. Being exposed to a lot of different environments has been a brilliant learning experience, as each organisation is unique and, therefore, forces you to try new things and approaches in your efforts to support change.</p>
    <p>This book is about sharing the toolkit I have developed during this time. Many of these tools were developed incrementally within teams I worked with, some literally taking years and exposure to a variety of organisations to reach their current state. My hope is to save you some of that time.</p>

    <h3>About the author:</h3>
    <p>Jeff is an Agile Coach, who considers the discovery of Agile and Lean to be one of the most defining moments of his life, and considers helping others to improve their working life not to be simply a job, but a social responsibility.</p>
    <p>He is also involved in the Agile community outside of the workplace being one of the founding members of Gothenburg Sweden’s largest agile community at 600+ members <a href="http://scrumbeers.com/">www.scrumbeers.com</a>, a community run agile discussion group that he has helped to spread to 4 countries. He also organizes the yearly conference <a href="https://brewingagile.org/">www.brewingagile.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>About the seminar: Experiment Driven Change</h3>
    <p>If yours is like most organisations, you are suffering from very common issues:
	    <ul>
	    	<li>Constantly over budget</li>
		    <li>Always late on the deliveries</li>
		    <li>Low quality</li>
		    <li>Long working hours</li>
		    <li>Overworked staff</li>
		    <li>Departments that don't work together</li>
		    <li>Deliveries that do not satisfy your customers</li>
	    </ul>
	It is tough to know how to start addressing these issues, especially since most of them are linked to and feed one another. Experiment-driven change is a model used by Agile and Lean organisations to address issues they encounter. It will not remedy any of these things for you overnight, but, it might start you down a path to doing so.</p>
	<p>This session is equally useful for anyone looking to improve their organisation, whether they are highly technical, or completely non-technical.</p>
