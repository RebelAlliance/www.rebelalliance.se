              <p>Jeff is a very talented Agile Coach who is passionate about getting your team to perform as well as possible. His interest for agile is genuine and shines through in everything he does. He has firm opinions, but is very easy-going and improves morale in the team by just being himself. He is responsive to others thoughts and questions. At the same time, he is thoughtful and typically has a long term plan with his work. One of his most important traits is that he always has the capacity to understand the customers situation and what the best course of action is. If I get the chance to work together with Jeff again, I would not hesitate to accept.</p>

              <p>If you are looking for a knowledgeable and inspirational Agile Coach with a great sense of humour and a positive attitude, you should hire Jeff Campbell. Jeff has worked in one of our Scrum teams at Nethouse for about one year. In his role as Agile Coach he has used his know how and his various tools to accomplish constant improvement and development of our working methods. He has also used his knowledge to inspire and motivate the team members to becoming a productive and well functioning team. I would recommend him whole heartedly. </p>

With his natural ability to communicate with all, Jeff easily and effectively gets buy-in from his team and engages them in the project tasks. He also has a talent for explaining technical issues to a non-technical audience as well as from the user perspective. I whole-heartedly recommend Jeff as a project leader, team leader, software & tools analyst as well as brand and company evangelist & team motivator.</p>

    <!--<p>I’ve always had a genuine interest for computers and programming. It all started back in 1994 with Quick Basic. With this interest follows that I explore and improve my work continuously. During my professional career I’ve gone from trying to find “silver bullets” (libraries and frameworks) to accepting that nothing can replace knowing the entire stack and keeping things as simple and lean as possible. This means that I always question everything.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Getting thrown straight into the action of something that’s falling apart is part of what I love. I’ve acquired techniques for quickly patching things up and to get to a “safe” state. A state where the product can be gradually improved with minimal risk and whilst adding features. I don’t believe in “big bang integrations” or “the complete rewrite” but to work in small batches, each validated and delivered.</p>-->

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>I am a Agile Coach who considers the discovery of Agile and Lean to be one of the most defining moments of my life, and consider helping others to improve their working life not to simply be a job, but a social responsibility. As an Agile Coach, I have worked with driving Agile transformations in organisations both small and large.</p>
          <p>I am heavily also involved in the Agile community outside of the work place as one of the founding members of Gothenburg's largest Agile community, at 300+ members <a href="http://www.scrumbeers.com">www.scrumbeers.com</a>, a community run Agile discussion group. I also organises the annual conference <a href="http://www.brewingagile.org">www.brewingagile.org</a>.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h2>Services</h2>
          <p>While difficult to perform, my role is easy to describe. I help individuals, teams, and organisation to improve themselves.</p>
          <p>My favourite way to achieve this is to get my hands dirty, working on a daily basis with organisations who build and delivery products and services. Working to help teams understand and apply Agile and Lean principles, practices, and tools on a continuous basis.</p>
          <p>However, I also provide introductions in the form on courses and workshops to help build enthusiasm, and provide your organisation with the basic toolset to get them started on their journey towards Agility.</p>
